# 🏅 Olympic 2024 Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing historical Olympic data to uncover patterns in medal distributions and country-wise performances using **Pandas** and **NumPy**. It's a beginner-friendly data analysis project for exploring how countries performed in the Olympics over time.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `Rank` – Ranking of the country based on total medals.
- `Country` – Name of the country.
- `Country Code` – Abbreviation of the country.
- `Gold` – Number of gold medals won.
- `Silver` – Number of silver medals won.
- `Bronze` – Number of bronze medals won.
- `Total` – Total number of medals.

There are 91 rows in the dataset, each representing a country.

## 📊 Objectives & Analysis Performed

Using **Pandas** and **NumPy**, the following basic analyses have been done:

- Countries with the highest number of gold medals.
- Countries that won more **silver** than **gold** medals.
- Countries with **no gold**, but at least **one silver or bronze**.
- Countries where the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals are **equal**.
- Country with the **highest Gold Medal Ratio** (Gold/Total Medals).
- Country at the **top rank (Rank 1)**.

These insights are achieved using basic filtering, conditional queries, and NumPy functions like `where`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- Jupyter Notebook (for code execution)



## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gourav-Attri-18/Olympic_2024_data_analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
3. Run the cells step by step to see the analysis.

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add more columns like year-wise medal stats or athlete-wise data.
- Perform group-based analysis (e.g., continent-wise, regional performance).
- Expand dataset to include Winter Olympics.
